algods is compose of algo(algorithm) and gods(go data structure).

## algorithm

- cg: Computer Graphics.
  - fdct_2d: 2d Forward Discrete Cosine Transform.
  - fdct_2d_new: 2d Forward Discrete Cosine Transform (mat made by 1d slice instead of 2d slice).

## math

- matrix: matrix operation.
  - matrix_2d: 2d matrix operation.
